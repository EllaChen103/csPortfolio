    <p id="cat-best">One of my favorite things are <em>cats</em>. Cats are the best animal because they are cute, easy to look after, and the best to hug. <br>I have one cat and she always meows loudly. She mostly stays indoors and sleeps everywhere. After a long day, picking <br>her up makes me happier. Also, all cats have adorable <strong>toe beans.</strong></p>

    <p>Volleyball is my favorite sport. Up until 7th grade, I hadn't been dedicated to any sport. Then, I was convinced to play on the school team that practiced at 6:30 in the morning, three times a week. Many of my friends had joined and soon we all spent time together passing the volleyball. Now, in 9th grade, I am on the high school team and practice everyday. I have games twice a week. All in all, volleyball is my favorite sport to play and my main source of exercise.<p/>

    <p>Another favorite of mine is dessert. Dessert is possibly my favorite meal of the day; it is required for me to eat everyday to ensure happiness. There are so many different types: some with <strong>chocolate</strong>, some with fruit, some with different combinations.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;" class="html-css">One new thing I am learning is how to program with HTML and CSS. <br>HTML is a webpage building code language that focuses mainly on the <strong>structure</strong> of the website. <br>CSS controls more of the <strong>styling</strong> of the website like <strong>coloring and borders</strong>.</p>

            <td>Inline CSS is putting CSS coding within your HTML tags for more specific visual changes. The way this is done is writing style="" within the opening tag. Each separate command in CSS in the same tag must be separated by a semi colon. In the quotation marks, the CSS is written.</td>
            <td>Borders are the rectangular area surrounding a tag and can be changed by writing border:px; and adding a number in front of px (pixel). The border can also be different colors and styles and must be written within the style quotations, tag, or file. Some examples are border-color:; </td>
            <td>Colors in CSS are changed by writing color:; and either writing which color or writing rgb() and putting three numbers that are separated by commas in the parenthesis. RGB stands for red, green, and blue, so the three numbers within the parenthesis decide how much of each color makes up the final color.</td>
            <td>Text is aligned by writing text-align:; and writing either left, right, or center after the colon. As implied by the title, this command will cause text to begin at either the right, left, or center depending on what is written.</td>
            <td>All content in HTML has three surrounding layers: padding, border, and margin. The padding is between the border and content while the margin is the area between the border and other content. To change these, one must write margin:; padding:; within a style tag or quotation. After the colon, one can change the size of the margin and cause the content to shift up, down, left and/or right. </td>
            <td>Fonts can be changed in many ways including size and family(type). Since this is also CSS, it must be included within the style quotations. To change the font size, one must write font-size:px; and put a number in front of px. To change the font family, one must write font-family:; and write the family after the colon.</td>
